# Java Algorithm Implementations

This document provides explanations and Java implementations for various algorithmic problems.

## Technical Exercises

### Exercise 1
1. Given an array of X numbers, find the two largest numbers.
2. Given an array of X numbers, find the two smallest numbers, ignoring negative values.
3. Implement the Merge Sort algorithm.

### Exercise 2
Merge two sorted arrays into a single sorted array.
Example:
```
Input: [1, 5, 12, 18] and [2, 4, 15]
Output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 12, 15, 18]
```

### Exercise 3
Given a database column storing float values as strings with trailing zeros, write a function to clean the unnecessary zeros.
```
Input:
12.0000000000
132.345000000
12354.3050000

Output:
12
132.345
12354.305
```

### Exercise 4
Given a flight route, check if the route from origin to destination is the exact reverse of the route from destination to origin.
```
Example:
Route: [NCE, PAR, DXB, TYO, DXB, PAR, NCE] -> OK
Route: [NCE, LON, LAX, NYC, NCE] -> KO
```

### Exercise 5
Check if a string containing `(` and `)` is balanced.
```
Example:
Input: "((()))" -> True
Input: "(()))(" -> False
```

### Exercise 6
Find the integer closest to zero in an array. If two numbers are equidistant, return the positive one.
```
Input: [7,2,-3,5,-8,-2,6,-4]
Output: 2
```

### Exercise 7
Convert a Roman numeral to a base-10 integer.
```
Example:
Input: "MMMDCI"
Output: 3601
```

### Exercise 8
Find all common characters between two lists.
```
Example:
Input: L1 = [a, e, e, e], L2 = [b, b, c, e, e, g]
Output: [e]
```

### Exercise 9
Find all pairs in an array whose sum equals a given number.
```
Input: [0, 14, 0, 4, 7, 8, 3, 5, 7], Sum = 11
Output: (7, 4), (3, 8), (7, 4)
```

### Exercise 10
Determine if a string is a palindrome.
1. Ignore spaces and special characters.
```
Example:
Input: "racecar" -> True
Input: "magazine" -> False
```
2. Consider spaces.
```
Example:
Input: "never odd or even" -> True
```

### Exercise 11
Find two numbers in an array that produce the highest product.

### Exercise 12
Count unnecessary zeros in float numbers.
```
Input: 1234.560000
Output: 4
```

### Exercise 13
Check if a sequence and its complementary sequence are palindromic.

### Exercise 14
Sort a list so that even numbers appear first in ascending order, followed by odd numbers in descending order.
```
Example:
Input: [93, 24, 38, 1, 87, 100]
Output: [24, 38, 100, 93, 87, 1]
```

### Exercise 15
Check if two strings are anagrams.

### Exercise 16
Find the two closest planes in the sky using the Euclidean distance formula.

### Exercise 17
Find the most frequently occurring character in a string.

### Exercise 18
Check if two words are anagrams.
Find duplicate elements in a list.
```
Example:
Input: [A,V,Y,Q,A,O,Q,I,N]
Output: [A,Q]
```

### Exercise 19
Pad a string to a specific length.
```
Example:
Input: ('0000', 123, 'L') -> "0123"
Input: ('00000000', 123, '') -> "12300000"
```

### Exercise 20
Find two numbers in an array with the highest absolute values.

### Exercise 21
Find the median of an array.
```
Example:
Input: [3, 5, 1, 7, 9]
Output: 5
```

### Exercise 22
Calculate the perimeter of an L-shaped figure.
```
Given:
- Horizontal segment: 5 cm
- Vertical segment: 6 cm
- Horizontal segment: 4 cm

Total Perimeter: Sum of all outer sides
```
